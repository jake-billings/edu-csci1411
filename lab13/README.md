# lab13 #
The purpose of lab13 is to demonstrate the use of classes and operators by creating a C++ class that stores three scores for a student
for a class. The main file collects scores for two students and prints the averages for each student using a function
declared in the `Scores` class.

Lab13 is a direct extension of the work performed in lab12.
