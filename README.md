This repository contains the work I completed for the course CSCI1411 Fundamentals of Computing Lab at the University of Colorado Denver. This work was completed the semester before I completed [CSCI2421 Data Structures and Program Design](https://github.com/jake-billings/edu-csci2421) and [CSCI2312 Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/jake-billings/edu-csci2312). I put a lot of effort into documenting this code. However, the more recent repositories also contain unit testing and may be a better code example.


## Labs ##
* Lab01: a very basic introduction lab; equivalent to Hello, World.
* Lab02: Overtime Pay Calculator - Determines how much to pay an employee based on various deductions and overtime considerations.
* Lab03: Rock, Paper, Scissors - Scores all cases for multiple rock paper scissors games; not practical for playing as the previous player's input is visible to the second player
* Lab04: Approximation of Pi using Taylor Expansion - Accepts user input to calculate pi to a given number of elements in a Taylor Series approximation of pi
* Lab05: Simple Game - Runs a simple 2-player game to exemplify the use of functions and random numbers. (Similar to Black Jack)
* Lab06: Magic 8 Ball - Implementation of a lab from 1410 - Demonstrates a menu system, data serialization, sorting, and arrays (using memmove() and malloc())
* Lab07: Movie Database - A program that reads movies from a file and processes the data appropriately (basically a simpler version of Lab06)
* Lab08: Movie Database Pt. 2 - An iteration of lab07 that includes sort and search functionality.
* Lab09: Test Score Database - A database of test scores that allows for the calculation of averages
* Lab10: CStrings - Read CStrings from the console and reverse them
* Lab11: Write pseudocode for CSCI1410 PA3 (see https://github.com/jake-billings/edu-c-demo)
* Lab12: Classes - Create a C++ class to store a student's grades in three quizzes for a semester class
* Lab13: Vectors, Operators, and Sorting - Extend Lab12 by adding an operator, a vector, and a sorting algorithm
