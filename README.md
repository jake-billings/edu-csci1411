Whoa! This should not be public. This is a repository I use to backup my work for the class CSCI1411 at University of Colorado Denver. If you're reading this, there's a good chance this repository has been made public by accident. Please let me know at [jake.billings@ucdenver.edu](mailto:jake.billings@ucdenver.edu). In the mean time, adhere to the university's honor code for work in the class.

My personal email is [jake@jakebillings.com](mailto:jake@jakebillings.com) in case there are any issues with my institutional email.

## Labs ##
* Lab01: a very basic introduction lab; equivalent to Hello, World.
* Lab02: Overtime Pay Calculator - Determines how much to pay an employee based on various deductions and overtime considerations.
* Lab03: Rock, Paper, Scissors - Scores all cases for multiple rock paper scissors games; not practical for playing as the previous player's input is visible to the second player
* Lab04: Approximation of Pi using Taylor Expansion - Accepts user input to calculate pi to a given number of elements in a Taylor Series approximation of pi
* Lab05: Simple Game - Runs a simple 2-player game to exemplify the use of functions and random numbers. (Similar to Black Jack)
* Lab06: Magic 8 Ball - Implementation of a lab from 1410 - Demonstrates a menu system, data serialization, sorting, and arrays (using memmove() and malloc())
* Lab07: Movie Database - A program that reads movies from a file and processes the data appropriately (basically a simpler version of Lab06)
* Lab08: Movie Database Pt. 2 - An iteration of lab07 that includes sort and search functionality.
* Lab09: Test Score Database - A database of test scores that allows for the calculation of averages
* Lab10: Coming Soon
* Lab11: Coming Not So Soon
