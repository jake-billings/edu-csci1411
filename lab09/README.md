# Lab09 #
The objective of Lab09 is to create an application that collects and stores test scores. This helps build skills using
malloc() and int pointers as arrays. The application dynamically sizes the array based on user input, collects input
to store in the array, prints the contents, and averages the contents.

A menu system was implemented for ease of use. This lab is essentially a simpler version of the implementation of
lab06.
